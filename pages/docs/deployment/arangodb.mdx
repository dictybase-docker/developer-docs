## Prerequisites

- Have a `configured (kubectl access)`
  [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) access.
- [Setup](/deployment/admin) cluster admin access.
- [Setup](/deployment/storageclass) custom storage class to use `SSD` disk.
- This guide assumes only one ArangoDB server instance for each cluster.

## Fresh Install

### ArangoDB custom resource definition (CRD)

> #### Version: 1.0.6

Install two charts, a `CRD` and `deployment controller`.

```shell
helm install https://github.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/releases/download/1.0.6/kube-arangodb-crd-1.0.6.tgz
helm install https://github.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/releases/download/1.0.6/kube-arangodb-1.0.6.tgz \
--set=operator.features.deploymentReplications=false --namespace dictybase
```

In the second step we are [disabling deployment replication](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/deployment-kubernetes-helm.html#operatorfeaturesdeploymentreplications).

### Install arangodb server (single deployment)

```shell
helm repo update
helm install dictybase/arangodb --namespace dictybase --set arangodb.dbservers.storageClass=fast \
--set arangodb.single.storage=50Gi
```

Here we are using the custom [storage class](/deployment/storageclass) and have also
set up the storage space. ArangoDB version `3.6.5` is also installed by
default. To see what else you can customize, check out the chart
[README](https://github.com/dictybase-docker/kubernetes-charts/tree/master/arangodb).

## Upgrade existing ArangoDB server

### Upgrade server instance

By default the chart will install the ArangoDB version `3.6.5`. To use another,
[pick a different version](https://hub.docker.com/_/arangodb/?tab=tags).

```shell
helm repo update
helm upgrade [RELEASE NAME] dictybase/arangodb --set=image.tag=[VERSION] --namespace dictybase
```

#### Very important notes

- Storage space of the database can only be increased, decreasing it is not
  possible (apparently PVC cannot be shrinked). The pod must be restarted to
  increase the storage.
  > `kubectl delete pod [POD NAME] -n dictybase`
- Use the helm chart directly to upgrade for patch versions (3.6.3 -> 3.6.5).
  To upgrade the minor versions (3.6.5 -> 3.7.2), you should backup and restore
  the database content in addition to the Helm chart upgrade process.

### Remove deployment (NOT CRD)

To upgrade the operator to the latest version with Helm, you have to
delete the previous deployment and then install the latest.

**HOWEVER**: You _must not delete_ the custom resource definitions (CRDs), or your
ArangoDB deployments will be deleted!

Therefore, you have to use `helm ls` to find the deployments for the
operator (`kube-arangodb`) and use `helm delete` to delete them using the
automatically generated deployment names. Here is an example of a `helm list` output:

```
% helm ls
NAME            	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART                               	APP VERSION	NAMESPACE
steely-mule     	1       	Sun Mar 31 21:11:07 2019	DEPLOYED	kube-arangodb-crd-1.0.6             	           	default
vetoed-ladybird 	1       	Mon Apr  8 11:36:58 2019	DEPLOYED	kube-arangodb-1.0.6                	           	default
```

So here, you would have to enter

> `helm delete vetoed-ladybird`

Make sure **not to delete `steely-mule`**. See official
[README](https://github.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/blob/master/README.md) for
more information. If wanting to upgrade to several releases ahead, it is
advised to upgrade incrementally (i.e. `1.0.3` to `1.0.5` to `1.0.6`, etc.).

### Upgrade CRD and install new Deployment

Upgrade the existing CRD (optional).

```shell
helm upgrade [RELEASE NAME] https://github.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/releases/download/[VERSION]/kube-arangodb-crd-[VERSION].tgz
```

Next, install the operator for `ArangoDeployment` while making sure to disable deployment replication.

```shell
helm install https://github.com/arangodb/kube-arangodb/releases/download/[VERSION]/kube-arangodb-[VERSION].tgz \
--set=operator.features.deploymentReplications=false --namespace dictybase
```

Verify that everything is working as expected, then proceed to the next version.
Repeat as necessary.

## Create new databases (in existing server instance)

```yaml
database:
  names:
    - annotation
    - auth
    - order
    - stock
  user: george
  password: costanza
  grant: rw
```

```shell
helm install dictybase/arango-create-database --namespace dictybase -f config.yaml
```

**Note:** this chart is capable of creating both databases and users in one shot.
If the user `george` in this example does not exist, this chart will create the
user and grant them `rw` permissions for the databases listed. If the user does
exist, this will update their grant privileges to `rw` or whatever you specify.

You can add more database names in the `names` parameters as necessary. Existing
ones will be skipped and new ones will be created.
